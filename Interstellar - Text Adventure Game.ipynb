    "    A) Introduction:\n",
    "    This game is based on the movie Interstellar (2014) by Christopher Nolan.\n",
    "    It consists of four stages, and also has defined functions for start, \n",
    "    success, and failure. This game is based on the plot of the movie. A \n",
    "    reading on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film) will help \n",
    "    although you are better off avoiding it to keep the game fresh and fun.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Round 1: Start by answering a basic question.\n",
    "    Round 2: Choose your plan to save humanity.\n",
    "    Round 3: Choose your path to move ahead.\n",
    "    Round 4: Make your choice.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    B) Known Bugs and/or Errors:\n",
    "    While the game accounts for variations in entries, it assumes that the \n",
    "    user doesn't make any spelling errors and does not use incorrect spacing.\n",
    "    Doing so might lead to failure even if the answer was known to the user.\n",
